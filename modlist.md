## üìù Notes

### ‚úÖ To-Do

- Mod pack Development Process
  1. Add More Mods
  2. Add addon/integration Mods
  3. Look Over Mod list for possible incompatibilities, like exploits, missing library/core mods, or unneeded/unrelated mods to the theme of the pack
  4. Configure Mods and Configs
  5. Do Live Check for incompatibilities with a test run of pack
  6. Fix incompatibilities
  7. Repeat if Necessary
- Link Every Mod (Feel free to leave links under here if you'd like me to do them for you)
- Add Descriptions for Each Mod

### üì• Suggestions

- Configuring unidict nicely so it works with all the mods, one case if I remember is thaumcraft's alchemical brass and any other brass should stay separate in recipes and creation.
