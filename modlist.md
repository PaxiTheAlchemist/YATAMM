## Notes

### To-Do

- Mod pack Development Process
  1. Add More Mods
  2. Look Over Mod list for possible incompatibilities, like exploits, missing library/core mods, or unneeded/unrelated mods to the theme of the pack
  3. Do Live Check for incompatibilities with a test run of pack
  4. Fix incompatibilities
  5. Repeat if Necessary
- Link Every Mod (Feel free to leave links under here if you'd like me to do them for you)
- Add Descriptions for Each Mod

### Suggestions

- Configuring unidict nicely so it works with all the mods, one case if I remember is thaumcraft's alchemical brass and any other brass should stay seperate in recipes and creation.

### Foot Notes

- ¹Journeymap may be favored due to FTB Utilities' team claiming which is visible on Journeymap
